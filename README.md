### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am majoring in Computer science and minoring in Psychology at McGill University. In the past, I worked on programming projects where I could merge my passions in Computer Science, Literature, and Music. I have experience in Machine Learning and Front-End Development. Alongside Computer Science, I also enjoy playing cello and reading books.
